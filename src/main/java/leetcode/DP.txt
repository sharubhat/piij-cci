 5 EasySteps to DynamicProgramming
 * 1. Define sub-problems count # sub-problems
 * 2. guess(part of solution) count#choices
 * 3. relate sub-problem solutions compute time/sub problem
 * 4. recurse + memoize time = time/sub problem * #sub-problems
 *     OR
 *     build DP table bottom-up check sub-problems acyclic / topological order
 * 5. solve original problem: = a sub-problem
 *     OR
 *     by combining sub-problem solutions ==> extra time
