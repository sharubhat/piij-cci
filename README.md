Solutions to problems from Programming Interviews in Java, Cracking Coding Interviews, Topcoder etc.

This repo is only to log my efforts and to keep track of all data structures and algorithms problems I solve. I have made a honest attempt to solve these problems on my own. Occasionally when the time to solve a problem goes beyond several hours, I may have referred to solutions provided in the books or over internet. There are only limited set of test cases that are available or can be written. If you refer to this codebase and find any bugs, please feel free to report them.
